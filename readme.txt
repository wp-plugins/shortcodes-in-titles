Shortcodes In Title give you the ability to use shortcodes in your titles without the hassle.

== Description ==
This plugin, makes it easier to add shortcodes in your post titles, by erasing the shortcode tag from the permalink and filtering the rest of your titles. That way, you only show the title with applied shortcodes where you want.

= Features =

* Wordpress generates the permalink of your post without the shortcode tag
* The shortcode will be striped from wp_title(), leaving the title intact

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins folder: 'wp-content/plugins/'
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php sc_title(); ?>` or `<?php echo get_sc_title(); ?>` in your templates where you want the title to appear
